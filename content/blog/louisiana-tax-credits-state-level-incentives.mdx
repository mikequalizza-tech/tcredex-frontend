Louisiana offers some of the most robust state tax-credit programs in the country, supporting real estate, film, and community development.

## Key Louisiana programs

### 1. Louisiana Historic Tax Credit (State HTC)

- Credit rate typically around 20%
- Eligible properties include historic commercial and certain residential buildings
- Credits are generally transferable
- Often stackable with Federal HTC, making historic rehab more feasible

### 2. Louisiana Motion Picture Production Credit

- Credit levels vary but can reach 25–40% depending on spend and thresholds
- Refundable and often transferable
- Widely used by film studios, production companies, and investors

### 3. Louisiana Digital Interactive Media Credit

- Credit support for software, gaming, and digital media production
- Designed to grow high-skill, high-wage sectors
- Works well with local talent and training initiatives

## Why Louisiana is attractive

- A **strong transferability market** with established buyers
- **Predictable program administration** with a track record of deals
- **High investor demand** for state credits relative to supply
- Ability to **pair state credits with NMTC, HTC, and other tools** in larger structures

## How tCredex helps

- **Modeling state + federal interactions** in capital stacks
- **Standardizing transferability documentation** and tracking
