Complex projects often require multiple funding sources. Modeling a capital stack correctly is essential for feasibility, compliance, and investor confidence.

## Step 1: Identify all sources

Common sources include:

- Senior debt
- Subordinate or mezzanine debt
- Sponsor equity
- NMTC leverage loans
- LIHTC equity
- HTC equity
- State credit equity or monetization proceeds
- Philanthropic capital and grants

## Step 2: Categorize each source

For each source, determine:

- **Debt vs. equity**
- **Restricted vs. unrestricted** (use of proceeds and covenants)
- **Timing of disbursement** (upfront, over time, milestone-based)
- **Compliance implications** (program-specific rules, use tests, recapture risks)

## Step 3: Build the layering

Start with:

1. Senior debt
2. Subordinate debt
3. Tax-credit equity and related loans
4. Sponsor equity
5. Grants or soft funds

Make sure sources and uses tie out, and that each layer is clearly defined in the model.

## Step 4: Model cash flow

Key items:

- Debt service and coverage ratios
- Investor returns and IRR hurdles
- QLICI disbursements and interest-only periods for NMTC
- Construction draws and cost-to-complete analysis
- Developer fee timing and pay-out sources

## Step 5: Validate compliance

Run checks for:

- QALICB tests (for NMTC)
- Eligible basis and unit mix (for LIHTC)
- QRE allocation and placed-in-service timing (for HTC)
- OZ asset tests and holding periods
- State credit-specific rules and reporting

## How tCredex helps

tCredex supports capital stack modeling by:

- **Providing pre-built capital stack templates** for common structures
- **Embedding compliance checks** into modeling workflows
- **Standardizing assumptions and outputs** across deals and teams
- **Generating documentation** that aligns with the modeled structure

A well-modeled capital stack is the foundation of a successful deal — and a platform-based approach makes that modeling reusable instead of one-off.
