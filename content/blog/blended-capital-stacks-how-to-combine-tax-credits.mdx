Complex community development projects often require more than one incentive. Blended capital stacks allow developers to combine multiple tax-credit programs to close financing gaps and strengthen project feasibility.

## Why blend credits?

- **Maximize available subsidy** by layering compatible programs
- **Reduce reliance on debt** and soften coverage constraints
- **Improve project viability** in locations or uses the market struggles to support alone
- **Support catalytic outcomes** like mixed-use hubs, cultural facilities, or specialized services

## Common blended structures

### NMTC + HTC

Ideal for historic commercial buildings in distressed areas.  
HTC supports the rehabilitation of the historic asset, while NMTC brings additional subsidy for community-serving uses.

### LIHTC + HTC

Used for adaptive reuse of historic buildings into affordable housing.  
HTC covers historic rehab costs while LIHTC drives the housing feasibility.

### NMTC + OZ

Combines OZ equity with NMTC leverage structures.  
OZ capital can provide part of the leverage loan or sponsor equity, with NMTC delivering additional subsidy.

### LIHTC + NMTC + HTC

One of the most complex but powerful combinations for mixed-use redevelopment where housing, commercial, and community uses coexist in or around a historic structure.

## Challenges in blended deals

- **Conflicting compliance periods** (5-year HTC, 7-year NMTC, 15-year LIHTC, 10-year OZ hold)
- **Entity layering** that must satisfy multiple regimes simultaneously
- **Alignment of QRE, QALICB, and QOZB rules**
- **Documentation complexity** across multiple investor groups and advisors
- **Exit strategies** that must work across different timelines and expectations
