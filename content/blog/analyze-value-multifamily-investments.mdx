This guide introduces fundamental concepts for analyzing and valuing multifamily real estate properties, designed for both novice and experienced investors.

## I. Fundamental Metrics

### Net Operating Income (NOI)

**Formula:** NOI = Effective Gross Income − Operating Expenses

NOI tells you how much income a property generates after accounting for all operating expenses but before financing costs. Effective Gross Income includes rental revenue plus ancillary income (pet fees, parking), minus vacancies and bad debt.

### Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)

**Formula:** Cap Rate = NOI / Property Value

A property generating $300,000 NOI valued at 10% cap rate equals $3,000,000. Small shifts in Cap Rate can have a dramatic impact on value:

| NOI | Cap Rate | Property Value |
|-----|----------|----------------|
| $300,000 | 8% | $3,750,000 |
| $300,000 | 10% | $3,000,000 |
| $300,000 | 12% | $2,500,000 |

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

**Formula:** DSCR = NOI / Debt Service

A DSCR of 1.25 indicates $1.25 of income for every $1.00 of debt obligations. Lenders typically require minimum DSCRs of 1.20-1.35 depending on property type and risk.

## II. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

The DCF approach projects future cash flows and terminal value, discounting them to present value.

### Example Calculation

**Assumptions:**
- Initial NOI: $300,000
- Annual Growth: 3%
- Discount Rate: 8%
- Hold Period: 10 years
- Exit Cap Rate: 6%

**Year-by-Year Cash Flows:**

| Year | NOI | Present Value |
|------|-----|---------------|
| 1 | $300,000 | $277,778 |
| 2 | $309,000 | $264,918 |
| 3 | $318,270 | $252,656 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | $391,638 | $181,371 |

**Terminal Value:** Year 10 NOI × (1 + growth) / Exit Cap Rate

**Total Present Value:** ~$5.3 million

## III. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

IRR represents the annualized return where NPV equals zero, enabling investment comparison across different opportunities.

### IRR vs. Other Metrics

- **Cash-on-Cash Return:** Annual cash flow / equity invested
- **Equity Multiple:** Total distributions / equity invested
- **IRR:** Time-weighted return accounting for when cash flows occur

IRR favors investments returning capital quickly, while equity multiple favors total returns regardless of timing.

## IV. Capital Structure

Understanding the capital stack is essential for analyzing risk and return.

### Capital Stack Hierarchy (Highest Risk to Lowest)

1. **Common Equity:** Highest risk, highest potential return
2. **Preferred Equity:** Priority over common equity, fixed returns
3. **Mezzanine Debt:** Subordinate to senior debt, higher rates
4. **Senior Debt:** Lowest risk, secured by property

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

WACC represents the blended cost of all capital sources:

**Example:**
- Senior Debt (60% of stack): 5% interest
- Equity (40% of stack): 15% required return

**WACC:** (0.60 × 5%) + (0.40 × 15%) = 9%

## V. Common Pitfalls

### Overestimating Growth

Aggressive rent growth assumptions inflate valuations. Use conservative, market-supported projections.

### Underestimating Expenses

Common oversights include:
- Capital expenditure reserves
- Property management fees
- Insurance increases
- Property tax reassessment

### Ignoring Market Risks

Consider:
- Local employment trends
- New construction pipeline
- Demographic shifts
- Regulatory changes

### Neglecting Refinancing Risk

Interest rates change. Model scenarios where refinancing occurs at higher rates than current debt.

### Disregarding Interest Rate Impact

Rising rates affect both:
- Debt service costs
- Cap rates (and thus property values)

## Conclusion

Successful multifamily analysis requires understanding fundamental metrics, applying appropriate valuation models, and recognizing the limitations of each approach.

Key takeaways:
- NOI is the foundation of all valuation methods
- Small cap rate changes create large value swings
- DCF captures growth and timing; cap rates provide quick comparisons
- IRR enables comparison across investments
- Conservative assumptions protect against downside risk

Master these concepts to make informed investment decisions in multifamily real estate.
