## What is AutoMatch?

AutoMatch is tCredex's AI-driven matching engine that connects:

- **Sponsors** with CDEs and investors who fit their project
- **CDEs** with qualified NMTC projects seeking allocation
- **Investors** with tax credit opportunities matching their criteria

It eliminates manual searching and surfaces the best matches automatically.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Profile Analysis

AutoMatch reads your profile and preferences:

**For Sponsors:**
- Project location and census tract
- Program eligibility (NMTC, LIHTC, HTC, OZ)
- Financing needs and timeline
- Community impact metrics

**For CDEs:**
- Geographic focus areas
- Target sectors and deal sizes
- Distress requirements
- Deployment timeline

**For Investors:**
- Investment criteria and credit types
- CRA assessment areas
- Yield and size parameters
- Sector preferences

### 2. Matching Algorithm

When a new project or profile enters the system, AutoMatch:

1. Scans all relevant counterparties
2. Scores each potential match
3. Ranks by compatibility
4. Surfaces top matches to both parties

### 3. Match Notifications

You receive notifications when:

- A new high-scoring match appears
- A match moves to a new stage
- Updated information improves match quality

## Match Scoring

Matches receive a score based on alignment across key factors:

| Factor | Weight | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Geography | High | Project in CDE's target state |
| Program | High | Credit type matches investor focus |
| Deal Size | Medium | QLICI within CDE's range |
| Sector | Medium | Healthcare matches CDE's priority |
| Distress | Medium | Severely distressed tract |
| Timeline | Low | Alignment on close date |

Higher scores indicate stronger matches. Scores above 80 typically represent excellent fits.

## What Makes a Good Match

### For Sponsors + CDEs

Strong matches occur when:
- Project is in CDE's target geography
- QLICI request fits CDE's deal size range
- Sector aligns with CDE's mission
- Tract meets distress requirements
- Timeline works for deployment deadline

### For Sponsors + Investors

Strong matches occur when:
- Credit type matches investor focus
- Geography aligns with CRA needs
- Investment size fits investor parameters
- Project quality meets underwriting standards

## Improving Your Matches

### Keep Your Profile Updated

Outdated preferences lead to poor matches. Review and update regularly.

### Be Specific

Vague criteria produce broad, less useful results. Specific preferences drive better matches.

### Complete Your DealCard

For sponsors: higher completion tiers generate better matches. Tier 3 projects attract more attention than Tier 1.

## Match Actions

When you receive a match, you can:

- **View** the full DealCard or profile
- **Save** to your pipeline for later review
- **Express Interest** to signal intent
- **Decline** to remove from your match list

---

## Behind the Scenes

AutoMatch uses:

- Census tract eligibility data
- Real-time profile comparisons
- Historical deal patterns
- Preference weighting algorithms

The system improves over time as more deals close and feedback loops refine the model.
