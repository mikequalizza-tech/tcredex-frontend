The tax-credit industry has long operated in silos. LIHTC teams use one set of tools. NMTC teams use another. HTC, OZ, and state credit practitioners rely on spreadsheets, PDFs, and institutional memory.

tCredex changes that.

## The five programs tCredex supports

### 1. Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)

Standardized underwriting, eligible basis modeling, and investor documentation to support affordable housing transactions.

### 2. New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC)

Guided leverage structures, compliance workflows, and QALICB validation for community and economic development projects.

### 3. Historic Tax Credits (HTC)

QRE tracking, Part 1–3 documentation support, and twinned structure templates for HTC + NMTC and HTC + LIHTC.

### 4. Opportunity Zones (OZ)

Asset-test tracking, QOZB structuring, and investor reporting for long-term equity in distressed communities.

### 5. State Tax Credits

Modeling, compliance, and documentation for state-level programs across the country, including transferability workflows.

## Why a unified platform matters

For the first time, practitioners can:

- **Build blended capital stacks** without recreating structures from scratch
- **Standardize documentation** across programs, deals, and teams
- **Reduce compliance risk** with practitioner-built rules baked into workflows
- **Accelerate deal timelines** by cutting friction out of closing
- **Operate from a single source of truth** instead of scattered files and emails

## Built by practitioners, not outsiders

tCredex is informed by decades of experience — including CDE operations, multiple allocation awards, and billions syndicated. The platform encodes what seasoned practitioners already know and brings that discipline to every deal.

## The future of tax-credit finance

tCredex is more than software.  
It's the missing infrastructure for a fragmented industry — a shared operating system for tax-credit finance.
