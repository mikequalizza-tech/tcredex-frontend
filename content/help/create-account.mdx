## Before You Start

tCredex supports four organization types. Choose the one that fits your role:

| Type | You Are... |

| **Sponsor** | Developer, nonprofit, or community org seeking financing |
| **CDE** | Community Development Entity with NMTC allocation |
| **Investor** | Bank, insurance company, or fund purchasing credits |
| **Admin** | Platform administrator (by invitation only) |

Not sure? Most users are **Sponsors**. If you're submitting a project for financing, that's you.
