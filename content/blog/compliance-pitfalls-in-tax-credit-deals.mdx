Tax-credit programs offer powerful incentives — but they come with strict compliance requirements. A single oversight can jeopardize credits, trigger recapture, or derail a project.

## Pitfall #1: Incomplete or inconsistent documentation

Missing agreements, outdated financials, or inconsistent reporting create audit and investor risk.

**Solution:**  
Use centralized document management, standardized naming conventions, and automated checklists tied to each program's requirements.

## Pitfall #2: Misaligned entity structures

Incorrect layering or missing entities can invalidate credits or break allocations.

**Solution:**  
Start with validated structure templates and entity diagrams. Confirm roles, ownership, and program-specific requirements before drafting documents.

## Pitfall #3: Failure to monitor ongoing compliance

Compliance is not a one-time event at closing — it's a multi-year obligation.

**Solution:**  
Implement automated compliance workflows, calendar-based alerts for reports, and standardized monitoring packages for borrowers and projects.

## Pitfall #4: Misclassification of expenditures

QRE vs. non-QRE, eligible basis, or QALICB qualification errors are common and can be expensive.

**Solution:**  
Use clear categorization tools, shared cost ledgers, and real-time validation checks tied to program rules.

## Pitfall #5: Poor communication between stakeholders

Developers, CDEs, investors, and lenders often operate in silos and assume shared understanding that doesn't exist.

**Solution:**  
Adopt shared dashboards, transparent workflows, and standard reporting packages that keep every party aligned on status and risk.
