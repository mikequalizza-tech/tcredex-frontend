When discussing buildings, people often reference their use or design—a high-rise, townhome, or mixed-use development. However, beneath every project lies a critical technical classification that determines construction methodology: its Type of Construction.

Per the International Building Code (IBC), construction type dictates fire resistance requirements, permissible materials, and maximum building dimensions. These five classifications balance safety, cost, and design flexibility, directly influencing development feasibility in multifamily and affordable housing sectors where budgets, financing, and efficiency demand scrutiny.

## Why Construction Type Matters

Each construction type represents a tradeoff. Type I buildings using concrete and steel provide maximum fire resistance and impressive heights, while Type V wood-framed structures offer cost-effectiveness with stricter height and density restrictions. Intermediate types (II, III, IV) blend materials and protections, enabling developers to balance expenses with safety performance.

For affordable housing developers, these distinctions function as financial strategy. Construction type selection affects:

- **Building height and density**, driving unit count potential
- **Fire rating requirements**, determining material and construction costs
- **Financing and insurance**, assessed by lenders based on structural classification
- **Long-term operations**, influenced by material durability and system design

Misclassification carries consequences: overclassification inflates unnecessary costs, while underclassification creates safety or compliance risks stalling approvals and complicating financing. Correct classification ensures buildings perform safely, efficiently, and sustainably.

## Overview of Construction Types

The IBC categorizes all structures into five construction types (I–V), each balancing combustibility, fire resistance, and allowable building dimensions.

Fundamental principles:
- Higher fire resistance enables taller, larger buildings
- Greater material combustibility permits lower allowable heights and areas, typically at reduced cost

Each type includes "A" and "B" subcategories:
- **A = Protected:** Higher fire-resistance ratings (1–3 hours)
- **B = Unprotected:** Lower or absent fire-resistance ratings

## Types I & II – Noncombustible Construction

Type I and Type II buildings represent the noncombustible hierarchy tier. Utilizing reinforced concrete, steel, and masonry, they deliver maximum fire resistance and support greatest code-permitted heights.

### Type I Construction

- **Materials:** Reinforced concrete, protected steel
- **Fire Resistance:** 2–3 hours
- **Applications:** High-rise towers, hospitals, institutional facilities
- **Advantages:** Maximum height and area allowances, superior durability, reduced insurance costs
- **Drawbacks:** Highest construction expenses and extended timelines

Type I structures frequently serve as mixed-use project podiums (parking, retail, amenities) supporting wood-framed residential upper levels.

### Type II Construction

- **Materials:** Similar to Type I with reduced fireproofing
- **Fire Resistance:** 0–2 hours
- **Applications:** Mid-rise commercial buildings or residential podiums
- **Advantages:** Lower costs than Type I, accelerated construction
- **Limitations:** Decreased fire ratings and height restrictions

Types I and II provide structural foundations for urban affordable housing podiums, enabling dense mixed-use projects balancing safety with upper-level construction efficiency.

## Type III – Exterior Noncombustible, Interior Combustible

Type III construction functions as modern affordable housing's primary workhorse. It merges noncombustible exterior walls (masonry, concrete, fire-retardant-treated wood) with wood-framed interiors, achieving fire safety and cost equilibrium.

### Podium-Style Construction

Type III anchors the "5-over-1" model—five wood-framed residential stories atop concrete or steel podiums (Type I or II). This design:

- Maximizes density while controlling expenses
- Satisfies urban fire codes
- Represents standard LIHTC and workforce housing construction nationwide

### Benefits for Affordable Housing

- Cost-efficient with fire safety code compliance
- Enables 4–6 story density within mid-rise zoning
- Accommodates mixed-use or structured parking podiums

Type III bridges expensive high-rises and limited garden apartments, dominating urban affordable housing development.

## Type IV – Heavy Timber (Mass Timber)

Before steel and concrete dominated, timber—massive beams and posts still standing in 19th-century factories—built cities. Modern mass timber represents this tradition's engineered evolution.

### Definition

- **Exterior walls:** Noncombustible materials
- **Interior structure:** Large solid wood members (glulam, CLT, SCL)
- **Fire resistance:** Achieved through charring; current code allows 18-story Type IV-A structures

### Advantages

- **Fire Performance:** Heavy timber chars slowly, maintaining structural integrity
- **Sustainability:** Carbon storage with reduced embodied emissions
- **Aesthetics:** Exposed wood interiors create warm, biophilic environments

### Challenges

- Higher material costs and constrained supply chains
- Inconsistent jurisdictional code adoption
- Specialized contractor and lender familiarity requirements

For sustainability-committed developers or green-funded projects, mass timber offers environmental benefits with mid-rise density—an emerging affordable housing innovation opportunity.

## Type V – Fully Combustible Construction

Type V represents the simplest, most economical construction approach, permitting wood-framed exterior and interior construction.

### Applications

- **Framing:** Dimensional wood or engineered trusses
- **Common forms:** Garden-style apartments, townhomes, modular units
- **Advantages:** Lowest per-square-foot costs, rapid construction, maximum flexibility

Type V remains affordable housing's entry point, particularly in suburban and rural markets with moderate land expenses and height-limited zoning. It enables developers delivering small-scale housing at subsidy-aligned price points.

## Comparing Construction Types for Multifamily Affordable Housing

- **Type III** dominates urban development through cost-efficiency and code compliance balance
- **Type V** leads suburban and small-scale projects
- **Type I/II** apply to mixed-use or high-rise contexts
- **Type IV** emerges as the sustainable alternative

Modern affordable housing frequently combines types—for instance, Type I concrete podiums with Type III wood-framed upper sections—balancing safety, density, and expense.

## Choosing the Right Type for the Right Context

Every building communicates through structure, not just aesthetics. Construction type selection defines expense, feasibility, and community consequences.

Developer decisions pivot on three factors:
- **Cost:** What financing and subsidies support?
- **Context:** What scale fits the site and neighborhood?
- **Compliance:** Which fire and safety standards apply?

Affordable housing development transcends mere construction—it demands thoughtful building. Each material, system, and classification influences community growth's safety, efficiency, and equity. Selecting appropriate construction types converts developer missions into tangible reality where safety, affordability, and design create enduring homes.
