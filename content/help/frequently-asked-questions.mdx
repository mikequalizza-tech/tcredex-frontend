## How do I use tCredex without creating an account?

You can browse the Marketplace, view public DealCards, and explore program resources without registering.  
To submit a project, receive matches, or enter the Closing Room, you’ll need to create a free account.

## Do I need to complete the entire Intake Form before my project goes live?

No. Once you reach **Tier 1 (40% completion)** your DealCard becomes visible on the Marketplace.  
You can continue updating your project at any time.

## What tax credit programs does tCredex support?

tCredex currently supports **NMTC, LIHTC, HTC, OZ**, and a growing list of **state-level credits**.  
Your eligible programs appear automatically based on your project’s location and details.

## How does AutoMatch work?

AutoMatch analyzes your project profile, census tract, program eligibility, and financing needs to identify compatible **CDEs, investors, and credit buyers**.  
You’ll receive match notifications as soon as your DealCard is published.

## Can I update my project after submitting it?

Yes. You can update any section of your Intake Form at any time.  
Your DealCard refreshes automatically, and CDEs see the latest version.

## What happens if I don’t complete Tier 2 or Tier 3?

Your project still appears on the Marketplace at Tier 1.  
Higher tiers simply unlock:

- Tier 2: Full Project Profile + CDE Matching
- Tier 3: Due Diligence Ready + Priority Matching

You can progress through tiers whenever you’re ready.

## What payment methods does tCredex accept?

tCredex currently supports standard online payment methods for premium features, including major credit cards.  
Most Marketplace features — including project submission and matching — are free.
