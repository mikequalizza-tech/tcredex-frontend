# Codebase Review

## Overview
High-level review of the tCredex frontend codebase, focusing on discoverability, correctness, and product readiness for the current Next.js App Router project.

## Strengths
- Clear component organization with isolated feature sections for the marketing pages.
- Consistent use of Tailwind utility classes and shared layout through the global `Header` component.

## Issues & Recommendations
All previously identified issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Site metadata updated to tCredex branding
- ✅ Navigation pages (`/how-it-works`, `/dashboard`) created with placeholder content
- ✅ Scaffolded API endpoint removed

## Suggested Next Steps
- Build out full functionality for placeholder pages as product requirements solidify.
- Continue monitoring for any additional scaffolded code that may need removal.
