Mass timber has captured significant attention in design, development, and construction circles in recent years. Engineers reference technical names like cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glue-laminated beams. Architects highlight its warmth and biophilic qualities, while sustainability advocates emphasize its carbon storage potential. Increasingly, multifamily and affordable housing developers are evaluating whether this material belongs in their toolkit.

## Understanding Mass Timber

Mass timber encompasses engineered wood products manufactured into large structural elements. CLT involves perpendicular-laminated lumber layers creating panels for floors, walls, and roofs. Glulam uses parallel layers for beams and columns. Additional products include dowel-laminated timber, nail-laminated timber, and mass plywood—all joining smaller wood pieces into engineered units.

These differ fundamentally from light-frame wood construction (typical single-family and low-rise multifamily) and older heavy timber relying on solid sawn pieces. Mass timber elements provide consistent engineered strength for mid-rise and high-rise applications. The 2021 and 2024 International Building Code permits mass timber structures up to 18 stories.

## Developer Interest: Four Key Advantages

### 1. Faster Construction Through Prefabrication

CLT panels are fabricated off site, cut to precise dimensions, numbered, and delivered in exact installation order. Projects achieve full structural levels within days. Shorter schedules reduce carrying costs and accelerate market entry.

### 2. Lightweight Construction Benefits

Reduced weight compared to concrete decreases foundation loads, benefiting sites with poor soils. Lighter structures facilitate vertical additions and provide seismic advantages where weight generates significant building forces.

### 3. Carbon and Sustainability

Mass timber stores carbon captured during tree growth while avoiding steel and concrete's high embodied emissions. Studies estimate combined substitution effects and carbon storage can reduce embodied carbon by approximately 69 percent.

### 4. Real Affordable Housing Examples

Heartwood in Seattle comprises eight stories with 126 workforce units using CLT floors and glulam columns. In New Haven, the 340+ Dixwell project (under construction) features 69 affordable units using CLT, supported by USDA Wood Innovations Grants.

## Critical Considerations for Developers

### Insurance Costs and Underwriter Familiarity

Insurers often price mass timber like traditional wood-framed construction despite different fire behavior characteristics. Premiums may remain uncompetitive with non-combustible materials, significantly impacting affordable housing developers operating within tight margins.

### Supply Chain Limitations

CLT and mass timber components typically involve custom fabrication with several-month lead times. Delivery sequencing must align precisely with construction schedules. Out-of-order arrivals or project delays create substantial disruption risks. Limited qualified installer availability in many markets compounds these challenges.

### Moisture Sensitivity During Construction

Protected mass timber performs well, but construction exposure creates vulnerability. Panels require rapid installation, protection from standing water, and continuous monitoring. Weather delays pose significant risks for predictable schedules.

### Permitting and Code Adoption Variability

Despite 2021 and 2024 IBC guidance, local adoption and reviewer expertise vary significantly. Building officials, fire marshals, and plan reviewers frequently lack CLT evaluation experience, lengthening approvals and introducing uncertainties challenging tax-credit-driven development cycles.

## Cost Analysis

Mass timber materials cost similarly to or slightly exceed conventional concrete and steel per square foot. System-wide savings emerge when considering reduced schedules, lower labor requirements, fewer trades, lighter foundations, and waste reduction.

Brock Commons (Vancouver's 18-story mass timber building) achieved 65 percent less waste versus equivalent concrete structures. An analysis of eighteen case studies found approximately 4 percent average cost savings, though variability remained high—particularly problematic for affordable housing developers requiring reliable budgets.

## Realistic Assessment for Affordable Housing

Mass timber offers appealing qualities—particularly construction speed and wood interior aesthetics. However, affordable housing operates where minor cost shifts and scheduling risks jeopardize projects.

Building codes and housing authority requirements frequently mandate flooring and drywall over interior surfaces for fire protection and acoustic performance, limiting exposed wood visibility in multifamily applications versus offices, labs, and civic buildings.

Concrete often provides longer building lifecycles, broader contractor experience pools, and more predictable insurance rates. Mass timber introduces additional insurance premiums and underwriting questions due to continued lender and insurer learning curves.

Despite challenges, mass timber delivers meaningful benefits. Shorter construction durations reduce general conditions and carrying costs while accelerating market entry. Mission-driven developers value lower embodied carbon. However, speed advantages depend directly on supply chain proximity.

## Final Thoughts

Mass timber represents neither clear fit nor inherent mismatch for affordable housing. Instead, it offers both strong potential and real constraints. Developers must evaluate context, team experience, supply chain conditions, jurisdictional readiness, and lender/insurer risk tolerance. Appropriate combinations create value; others introduce uncertainty exceeding LIHTC capital stack tolerance.

As industry familiarity increases and supply chains mature, some constraints may ease. Currently, mass timber offers real potential alongside real considerations. Each project team must thoughtfully weigh these elements determining whether this construction approach aligns with specific development goals, conditions, and contexts.
