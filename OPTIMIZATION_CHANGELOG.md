---

## 🚀 How to Use the Optimizations

### 1. Update Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in your actual values
```

### 2. Use the Optimized Config (Optional)
```bash
# Rename the optimized config to use it
mv next.config.js next.config.old.js
mv next.config.optimized.js next.config.js
```

### 3. Rebuild the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Test Performance
```bash
npm run start
# Use Lighthouse or similar tools to measure improvements
```

---

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Review and update `.env.local` with all required variables
2. ✅ Test the application with the new logging system
3. ✅ Verify security improvements in production
4. ✅ Monitor performance metrics

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement lazy loading for remaining large components
2. Add error boundary components
3. Integrate with error tracking service (Sentry)
4. Set up performance monitoring (Vercel Analytics)

### Medium-term (1 month)
1. Implement service worker for offline support
2. Add progressive web app features
3. Optimize database queries
4. Implement request caching with Redis

### Long-term (2-3 months)
1. Migrate to proper state management (Zustand/Redux)
2. Create comprehensive component library
3. Add end-to-end testing
4. Implement CI/CD pipeline with performance budgets

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Stub Implementations
The following features are still stubbed and need real implementations:
- Stripe payment processing (`lib/stripe/checkout.ts`)
- SAM.gov debarment checking (`lib/compliance/debarment.ts`)
- Email sending (uses console.log in development)

### Dead Routes
Consider removing or consolidating:
- `/css/` - Unused CSS directory
- `/tract-map/` - Duplicate of `/map/`
- `/faq/` - Minimal content

### Dependencies
Some packages may be unused and could be removed:
- Review `@types/*` packages
- Check for unused utility libraries

---

## 📈 Metrics to Monitor

### Performance Metrics
- Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)

### Security Metrics
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Input validation failures
- CSRF token usage

### User Experience Metrics
- Time to Interactive
- First Contentful Paint
- Cumulative Layout Shift
- Error rates
