Affordable housing is often discussed as a production challenge. We talk about how many units we need to build, how long it takes to entitle new projects, and how rising construction costs make feasibility increasingly elusive. All of that is true. But focusing only on new construction misses a quieter, equally consequential problem: we are steadily losing the affordable housing we already have.

Preservation is the practice of protecting existing affordable housing from loss. Whether through expiring affordability restrictions, physical deterioration, or market pressure. It is not a secondary strategy or a stopgap measure. Preservation is a core pillar of the housing solution. Without it, new construction becomes a race against a shrinking baseline, much like pouring water into a bucket with a hole in the bottom .

### What Do We Mean by “Affordable Housing Preservation”?

Affordable housing preservation has two closely related meanings.

First, it refers to preserving long-term affordability. Many affordable housing properties are subject to time-limited use restrictions tied to government subsidies, financing programs, or tax credits. When those restrictions expire or when owners are permitted to exit them rents can rise to market levels, permanently removing those units from the affordable housing stock.

Second, preservation refers to preserving the physical housing itself. Much of the nation’s affordable housing was built decades ago. These buildings often suffer from deferred maintenance, outdated systems, and capital needs that cannot be supported by restricted rents alone. Without reinvestment, affordability can technically remain in place while habitability erodes or properties can deteriorate to the point of failure.

These two dimensions are inseparable in practice. Extending affordability typically requires recapitalization and rehabilitation, while rehabilitation programs often require renewed affordability commitments. Historically, however, preservation policy has leaned more heavily toward affordability restrictions than physical reinvestment, contributing to an aging and increasingly fragile housing stock

Preservation also spans both **“** Big A” affordable housing properties with formal subsidies and regulatory agreements and “little a” or naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH), which remains affordable due to age, condition, or location rather than regulation. Both are at risk, though the mechanisms differ

### Why Preservation Matters More Than Ever

 **Preventing Displacement and Instability**

When affordable housing is lost, displacement is not theoretical. Residents face rent increases, forced moves, longer commutes, overcrowding, or homelessness. Preservation keeps people housed in their communities near schools, jobs, healthcare, and social networks and prevents the cascading disruptions that follow displacement.

While tenant protection vouchers can mitigate some impacts, they are not universally available. In many cases, preservation is the only tool that ensures continuity for existing residents

 **Cost, Speed, and Public Value**

Preservation is generally faster and less expensive than new construction. Existing buildings already have land, zoning, infrastructure, and community acceptance. Rehabilitation can often deliver units more quickly and at lower per-unit cost than ground-up development, particularly in high-cost or supply-constrained markets.

Preservation also protects decades of public investment. Federal, state, and local governments have already subsidized land acquisition, construction, and operations. Allowing those units to convert to market-rate housing represents not just a housing loss, but a loss of public capital that cannot easily be replaced.

 **Climate and Sustainability Benefits**

Rehabilitating existing buildings typically produces fewer carbon emissions than demolishing and rebuilding. Preservation avoids the embodied carbon of new construction and provides opportunities to upgrade energy systems, reduce utility costs, and improve environmental performance.

Many affordable properties are also located in transit-accessible, walkable communities. Preserving them helps maintain access to opportunity-rich neighborhoods while supporting broader sustainability and transportation goals

### Why Affordable Housing Gets Lost

Affordable housing is not usually lost overnight. It erodes through predictable and compounding pressures.

One major driver is expiring affordability restrictions. Programs such as project-based Section 8, USDA Rural Development loans, and LIHTC impose affordability requirements for a defined period. Once those periods end, owners may legally increase rents, convert units, or sell to buyers with no affordability obligations.

Another driver is insufficient net operating income. Rent-restricted properties cannot raise rents to cover rising insurance costs, utilities, property taxes, or capital needs. Over time, this imbalance can push non mission driven owners to defer maintenance, seek exits, or default.

Market pressure intensifies these risks. In strong or rapidly appreciating neighborhoods particularly near transit the gap between restricted rents and market rents widens, making affordability increasingly difficult to sustain without intervention.

Researchers commonly describe preservation risk in three categories:

  *  **Exit risk** (loss of affordability through expiration or opt-out),

  *  **Depreciation risk** (physical and financial deterioration), and

  *  **Appropriations risk** (reliance on continued public funding that may not keep pace with costs)




### How Affordable Housing Preservation Works in Practice

 **Acquisition and Rehabilitation**

One common preservation strategy involves the acquisition of at-risk properties by mission-driven buyers often nonprofits or socially motivated for-profit developers followed by rehabilitation and recapitalization.

These transactions are complex. They require assembling layered financing from federal, state, and local sources; coordinating with existing residents; addressing relocation during construction; and navigating regulatory approvals. Each deal is shaped by local context, available subsidies, and property-specific conditions.

Case studies from across the country illustrate how preservation succeeds when developers have the capacity to manage complexity and when public policy provides flexible tools to compete with market-rate capital.

 **Recapitalization and Predictable Timing**

Many affordable housing properties require recapitalization on a predictable schedule. LIHTC properties, for example, often face major reinvestment needs around Year 15, when the initial compliance period ends, and again before Year 30, when extended-use requirements may expire.

Preservation transactions frequently rely on 4% LIHTCs paired with tax-exempt bonds to finance acquisition and rehabilitation. As hundreds of thousands of LIHTC units approach the end of their affordability periods, preservation demand is increasing faster than available resources

### Policy Tools That Enable Preservation

Preservation does not happen by accident. It depends on policy frameworks that align incentives and reduce barriers.

Some jurisdictions use notice and right-of-first-refusal laws, requiring owners to notify residents or qualified entities before selling or converting properties. These laws can create a critical window for preservation buyers to act.

Others provide flexible acquisition and predevelopment funds that allow mission-driven buyers to move quickly in competitive markets. Property tax abatements, preservation-oriented Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP) scoring, and rehabilitation grants can further support long-term affordability.

Equally important are data systems that identify at-risk properties before restrictions expire or conditions deteriorate. Without early identification, preservation opportunities are often missed

### Who Does Preservation Well and Why

Successful preservation requires more than capital. It requires experienced ownership, strong asset management, and long-term commitment.

Mission-driven developers with deep operational capacity are often best positioned to navigate preservation deals. Collaboration among sellers, lenders, public agencies, and residents is equally critical. In many successful cases, sellers are motivated to work with preservation buyers who will maintain affordability and community stability.

Policy networks and peer learning also matter. Sharing models, tools, and lessons across jurisdictions helps practitioners adapt successful approaches to local conditions

### Preservation Is Not the Alternative to New Construction

Preservation is sometimes framed as competing with new construction. This is a false choice. 

New construction is essential. But without preservation, new units simply replace those that are lost. Preservation stabilizes the existing housing stock while new development expands it. The two strategies are complementary, not interchangeable.

Affordable housing is not a one-time investment. Like infrastructure, it requires ongoing maintenance, reinvestment, and stewardship. Treating preservation as an afterthought undermines the effectiveness of every new unit built

### Holding On to What We’ve Already Built

Affordable housing preservation is ultimately about stewardship — of buildings, of public investment, and of communities.

As affordability pressures intensify and resources remain constrained, preservation offers one of the most cost-effective, humane, and sustainable ways to address housing needs. It keeps families housed, neighborhoods stable, and public dollars working longer.

The housing crisis will not be solved by building alone. It will be solved by building and preserving by recognizing that the most valuable affordable housing unit is often the one that already exists.
