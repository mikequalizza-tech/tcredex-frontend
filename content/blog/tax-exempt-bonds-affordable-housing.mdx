The biggest constraint on affordable housing production often isn't land, zoning, or community support—it's financing. Project borrowing capacity and equity availability determine what gets built, how quickly, and at what income levels.

Tax-exempt bonds play an essential but overlooked role. While less visible than the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), they quietly finance tens of thousands of affordable units annually and represent the majority of new affordable production in many states.

## What Tax-Exempt Housing Bonds Actually Are

Tax-exempt multifamily housing bonds are Private Activity Bonds (PABs) issued by state or local governments for privately owned projects serving public purposes. The key advantage: investors accept lower yields because interest is federally tax-exempt. Issuers pass these savings to developers as reduced borrowing costs.

Combined with 4% LIHTC access, tax-exempt bonds create one of affordable housing's most powerful financing tools.

## How Bond-Financed Multifamily Deals Work

Typical structures include:
- Tax-exempt loans funded by bond proceeds
- 4% LIHTC equity from investor credit sales
- Subordinate loans or grants from state/local housing agencies

Lower bond interest rates strengthen debt service coverage ratios, enable deeper affordability levels, and facilitate capital stack completion. Bonds can fund construction, permanent financing, or both.

## Volume Cap: The Gatekeeper to Production

Each state receives annual PAB authority based on population—$130 per capita in 2025. This "volume cap" must cover industrial development, student loans, water infrastructure, redevelopment, and other uses.

Demand far exceeds available authority. When states exhaust allocations, otherwise-viable affordable housing projects stall. Volume cap has traditionally been one of the most consequential bottlenecks in solving the housing shortage.

## How Bonds Unlock the 4% Tax Credit

Projects financing a minimum aggregate basis percentage with tax-exempt bonds automatically qualify for 4% LIHTC without competitive applications.

**The 2025 Change:** Congress reduced the requirement from 50% to 25% of aggregate basis—the most significant update to the 4% program in years.

**Practical outcomes:**
- More projects qualify for 4% credits
- States use less volume cap per deal
- More deals can be funded annually

**Critical Compliance:** Failing the 25% test disqualifies projects from all 4% credits, typically collapsing deal feasibility since LIHTC equity represents 30-40% of development costs.

## Affordability Requirements and Compliance

Bond-financed LIHTC developments must satisfy overlapping federal requirements:

1. Federal bond requirements
2. Federal LIHTC requirements under Section 42

**Federal Set-Aside Requirements:**

Bond-financed rental housing must meet minimum thresholds:
- 20% of units at 50% AMI, OR
- 40% of units at 60% AMI

These mirror original LIHTC options (20/50 and 40/60 tests). Compliance continues through the "qualified project period," tied to bond financing and tax credit duration.

**Additional Technical Requirements:**
- Acquisition/rehab deals require rehabilitation equal to 15% of bond-financed acquisition costs
- Costs of issuance capped at 2% of bond proceeds
- Only "eligible costs" count toward the 25% test and eligible basis

## Why Developers Choose Bond Deals

Despite complexity, bond-financed projects offer advantages:

1. **Deeper Affordability** – Lower debt costs enable deeper income targeting without compromising viability
2. **Reliable Equity Access** – 4% LIHTC provides predictable capital versus competitive 9% allocations
3. **Preservation at Scale** – Bonds excel in acquisition/rehabilitation with quick movement and large unit support
4. **Predictability** – More reliable and scalable than competitive 9% processes

## Why Tax-Exempt Bonds Matter Nationally

Housing bonds have financed over 1.5 million rental homes for lower-income families. The multifamily bond program unlocks tens of billions of development annually while enabling local job creation, neighborhood stabilization, asset preservation, and long-term affordability.

## The Financial Backbone of Affordable Housing Production

Tax-exempt bonds create financing structures that lower long-term debt costs, leverage private capital, and direct federal tax benefits toward stable, affordable rental homes. The 25% threshold expansion stretches limited volume cap further, increases community equity, and restores feasibility to previously impossible projects.

As affordable housing production, preservation, and equitable investment pressures mount, bonds remain one of the most dependable tools we have. Strengthening this program is essential for system growth rather than contraction.
