## The Intake Form is the Engine

Every deal on tCredex starts with the Intake Form. It's not just data collection—it's the engine that powers:

- Eligibility determination
- DealCard generation
- AutoMatch scoring
- Marketplace visibility
- Due diligence preparation

Understanding how the Intake Form works helps you maximize your results.

---

## Dynamic Form Behavior

The Intake Form adapts based on your inputs. Different programs show different fields.

### Program Selection Changes Everything

When you select **NMTC**:
- QALICB eligibility tests appear
- Leverage structure options show
- CDE matching activates

When you select **LIHTC**:
- Unit count and AMI targeting appear
- 4% vs 9% credit selection shows
- Housing-specific fields activate
- **NMTC option becomes blocked** (compliance rule)

When you select **HTC**:
- Historic designation status appears
- QRE (Qualified Rehabilitation Expenditure) fields show
- Part 1/2/3 status tracking activates

When you select **OZ**:
- Investment timing fields appear
- Substantial improvement questions show
- Holding period tracking activates

### Location Changes Eligibility

When you enter an address:

1. System geocodes to coordinates
2. Coordinates map to census tract
3. Tract data returns from the Map
4. Eligibility auto-populates:
   - NMTC eligible? Yes/No
   - Severely distressed? Yes/No
   - Opportunity Zone? Yes/No
   - QCT? Yes/No
   - State programs available? Listed

**You don't research eligibility. The system tells you instantly.**

## Tier System

The Intake Form calculates your completion tier automatically:

|------|------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | 40% | Marketplace listing, basic matching |
| **Tier 2** | 70% | Full profile, enhanced matching |

### What Counts Toward Completion

- Required fields (weighted heavily)

- Quality indicators (completeness, detail)

### Tier Impact on Matching

```
Tier 1 Project: Matches with 50+ score threshold
Tier 2 Project: Matches with 40+ score threshold
Tier 3 Project: Matches with 30+ score threshold + Priority flag
```

Higher tiers = more matches = faster deals.
