When communities invest public resources, they typically measure returns: roads reducing congestion, broadband spurring innovation, schools strengthening the workforce. Yet affordable housing discussions often focus solely on social necessity rather than economic benefit.

Is affordable housing a good investment? And if so, what is the ROI a community can expect?

Rising housing costs force workers into lengthy commutes while businesses struggle with employee turnover. These pressures weaken entire community economies. Historical precedent exists—from New Deal homeownership expansion to modern housing trust funds—demonstrating that strategic housing investments drive prosperity.

## The First Return: A Stable Workforce

When employees afford homes near workplaces, businesses thrive through improved attendance, reduced turnover, and sustained productivity. Housing affordability directly addresses employer recruitment challenges; without accessible housing, companies either raise wages substantially or lose talent to neighboring regions.

Salt Lake City exemplifies this approach, dedicating 10% of tax increment financing revenues to affordable housing near job centers. This isn't charity—it's strategy, anchoring workers while strengthening local business ecosystems and tax revenues.

## The Second Return: Economic Multipliers

Reduced housing costs increase disposable income for local purchases, fueling small businesses and sales tax revenues. The National League of Cities emphasizes how affordable housing allows money to circulate through the local economy rather than being siphoned off.

Housing Trust Funds leverage public investments at 3-to-4:1 ratios, unlocking millions in development funding. These projects generate immediate construction employment while increasing property values and the tax base long-term, creating virtuous economic cycles.

## The Third Return: Healthier Communities

Stable housing reduces emergency room visits and hospitalizations by preventing health crises and enabling treatment adherence. This cuts public healthcare costs through Medicaid, Medicare, and indigent programs.

Housing stability also addresses historical inequities. Policies like redlining prevented Black and Latino families from building generational wealth through homeownership. Contemporary affordable housing investments provide platforms for upward mobility while reducing downstream education and social service expenses.

## The Policy Multiplier

Historical public investments—the Federal Housing Administration, the GI Bill, 30-year mortgages—created middle-class prosperity, though they excluded communities of color.

Today's affordability crisis demands new public investment prioritizing inclusivity and economic vitality. Communities with diverse, affordable housing weather economic downturns better, maintain stable workforces, and foster innovation through diversity. Governments must recognize housing as critical infrastructure for long-term competitiveness.

## Housing as Prosperity Foundation

Like roads and broadband, affordable housing enables full economic participation. The measurable returns—stable workforces, stronger economies, healthier families, equitable communities—ripple across generations.

Without action, the housing crisis threatens economic competitiveness and community cohesion. Public investment in affordable housing isn't merely moral; it's strategic infrastructure development.
