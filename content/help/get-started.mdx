## What is tCredex?

tCredex is the AI-powered marketplace for tax credit financing.  
Developers, nonprofits, and community organizations use it to:

- Submit projects
- Discover eligible tax credit programs
- Get matched with CDEs, investors, and credit buyers
- Move deals into the Closing Room for due diligence

You don’t need to be a tax credit expert — the platform guides you step by step.

## Step 1: Create Your Free Account

You can browse the Marketplace without registering, but to submit a project or receive matches, you’ll need an account.  
Registration takes less than a minute.

---

## Step 2: Start the Intake Form

The Intake Form is your project’s foundation.  
It collects the details needed to:

- Generate your DealCard
- Determine program eligibility
- Match you with CDEs and investors
- Unlock your completion tier

You can complete sections in any order, and your progress saves automatically.

---

## Step 3: Reach Tier 1 (40% Completion)

Once you reach **Tier 1**, your DealCard goes live on the Marketplace.  
This is the fastest way to get visibility and start receiving matches.

---

## Step 4: Upload Key Documents

You can upload documents at any time, including:

- Phase I Environmental
- Site plans
- Financials
- Organizational documents

Uploads are optional for Tier 1 but recommended for Tier 2 and Tier 3.

---

## Step 5: Publish Your DealCard

When you’re ready, publish your DealCard.  
CDEs and investors can now:

- View your project
- Save it to their pipeline
- Request more information
- Invite you into the Closing Room

---

## Step 6: Respond to Matches

AutoMatch will notify you when a CDE or investor is a strong fit.  
You can message them directly or accept an invitation to begin due diligence.

---

## Step 7: Enter the Closing Room

The Closing Room is where deals move forward.  
You’ll find:

- Document checklists
- Secure file sharing
- Communication threads
- Status tracking

This is where projects become transactions.
