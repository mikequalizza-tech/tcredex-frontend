## Overview

tCredex helps CDEs discover high-quality NMTC projects faster, reduce time-to-close, and deploy allocation before deadlines.

This guide covers everything you need to know as a CDE using the platform.

---

## Your CDE Dashboard

When you log in, your dashboard shows:

- **Pipeline** - Projects you're actively working
- **Matches** - New projects that fit your criteria
- **Allocation Status** - Remaining allocation by year
- **Closing Room** - Active due diligence workspaces

---

## Setting Your Preferences

Your CDE profile determines which projects AutoMatch sends you.

### Geographic Focus
- Select primary states where you deploy
- Mark rural, urban, or tribal preferences
- Identify excluded areas (if any)

### Project Preferences
- Minimum/maximum QLICI request
- Target sectors (healthcare, education, manufacturing, etc.)
- Impact priorities (jobs, services, community facilities)
- Distress requirements (severely distressed, QCT, etc.)

### Deal Criteria
- Preferred leverage structures
- Related party policies
- Timeline requirements

> **Tip:** Be specific in your preferences. Better criteria means better matches.

## Finding Projects

### AutoMatch

AutoMatch analyzes new projects against your preferences and notifies you when strong matches appear.

Match scores reflect alignment on:
- Geographic fit
- Sector alignment
- Distress level
- Deal size
- Timeline

### Marketplace Browse

You can also browse the full Marketplace to discover projects outside your typical criteria.

Use filters to narrow by:
- State
- Program type
- Deal size
- Status

---

## Evaluating a DealCard

Each project's DealCard shows:

- **Project Summary** - Name, type, location, sponsor
- **Eligibility** - Census tract data, NMTC qualification
- **Financials** - TPC, QLICI request, financing gap
- **Impact** - Jobs, community benefit, special designations
- **Readiness** - Site control, environmental, timeline
- **Documents** - Uploaded materials for due diligence

---

## Expressing Interest

When you find a project you want to pursue:

1. Click **Flag for Review** to add it to your pipeline
2. Request additional information from the sponsor
3. If ready, move to **LOI Stage** in the Closing Room

---

## The Closing Room

Once you and a sponsor agree to proceed:

- **Document Checklists** - Track required materials
- **Messaging** - Direct communication with sponsor
- **Status Updates** - See where the deal stands
- **Compliance Prep** - Organize materials for closing

---

## Allocation Tracking

Track your remaining allocation by year:

- Federal allocation by award year
- State allocation (if applicable)
- Deployed vs. available

Set alerts for deployment deadlines to stay ahead.
