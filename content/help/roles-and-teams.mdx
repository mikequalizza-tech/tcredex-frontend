## The Four Roles

tCredex connects four types of organizations, each with distinct responsibilities in the tax credit ecosystem.

---

## 1. Sponsors (Developers & Nonprofits)

**Who they are:** Developers, nonprofits, and community organizations seeking tax credit financing for their projects.

**What they do on tCredex:**
- Submit projects through the Intake Form
- Generate DealCards visible on the Marketplace
- Receive matches from CDEs and Investors
- Enter the Closing Room for due diligence
- Upload documents and respond to requests

**Their journey:**
```
Intake Form → DealCard → Marketplace → Match → Closing Room → Close
```

**Key insight:** Sponsors are the deal originators. Every transaction starts with a Sponsor submitting a project.

---

## 2. CDEs (Community Development Entities)

**Who they are:** Certified intermediaries that receive NMTC allocation from the CDFI Fund and deploy it to qualified projects.

**What they do on tCredex:**
- Set deployment preferences (geography, sectors, deal size)
- Browse and receive matched projects
- Evaluate DealCards and request information
- Issue Letters of Intent (LOIs)
- Manage allocation tracking and deployment deadlines

**Their journey:**
```
Set Preferences → Receive Matches → Evaluate → Issue LOI → Closing Room → Deploy
```

**Key insight:** CDEs are ONLY involved in NMTC deals. Other programs (LIHTC, HTC, OZ) go directly from Sponsor to Investor.

---

## 3. Investors (Banks, Insurance, Funds)

**Who they are:** Financial institutions that purchase tax credits in exchange for equity investment.

**What they do on tCredex:**
- Set investment criteria (credit types, size, geography)
- Browse opportunities across all programs
- Evaluate deals for underwriting
- Issue commitment letters
- Track portfolio and compliance

**Their journey:**
```
Set Criteria → Receive Matches → Evaluate → Commit → Closing Room → Fund
```

**Key insight:** Investors participate in ALL credit programs. For NMTC, they work with CDEs. For other programs, they work directly with Sponsors.

---

## 4. Admins (Platform Operators)

**Who they are:** tCredex platform administrators.

**What they do:**
- Monitor platform activity
- Verify organizations
- Manage compliance
- Provide support

---

## How Roles Connect

### NMTC Deals (CDE Required)

```
SPONSOR → CDE → INVESTOR
   │        │        │
   │        │        └── Purchases credits, provides equity
   │        └── Allocates NMTC, structures deal
   └── Originates project, seeks financing
```

### All Other Programs (Direct to Investor)

```
SPONSOR → INVESTOR
   │           │
   │           └── Purchases credits, provides equity
   └── Originates project, seeks financing
```

**LIHTC, HTC, OZ, State Credits** all flow directly from Sponsor to Investor without CDE intermediary.

---

## Program Routing Logic

| Program | Route |
|---------|-------|
| NMTC | Sponsor → CDE → Investor |
| LIHTC | Sponsor → Investor |
| HTC | Sponsor → Investor |
| OZ | Sponsor → Investor |
| State Credits | Sponsor → Investor |

**Stacked Deals:** When a project uses multiple programs (e.g., HTC + NMTC), the Sponsor works with BOTH CDEs (for NMTC) AND Investors (for HTC).

**Important:** LIHTC and NMTC can NEVER be combined on the same project due to conflicting compliance requirements.

---

## Teams Within Organizations

Each organization can have multiple team members with different roles:

### Organization Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access, can invite members, manage settings |
| **Member** | Can view and work on deals, upload documents |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to deals and documents |

### Inviting Team Members

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter email and select role
4. Team member receives invitation

---

## Verification

Organizations go through verification to build trust:

- **Unverified** - New account, limited visibility
- **Verified** - Identity confirmed, full marketplace access

CDEs must provide certification numbers. Investors may need accreditation verification.
