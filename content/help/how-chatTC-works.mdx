## What ChatTC Cannot Do

ChatTC is an AI assistant and has limitations:

- **Not legal or financial advice** - ChatTC provides general information, not professional advice
- **Cannot make decisions for you** - Use ChatTC as a learning tool, not a decision-maker
- **May not have the latest regulatory changes** - Always verify critical information with official sources
- **Cannot access your account data** - ChatTC doesn't see your projects or personal information

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start simple** - Begin with a basic question and drill down
2. **One topic at a time** - ChatTC works best with focused questions
3. **Use specific terms** - Mention program names (NMTC, LIHTC) when relevant
4. **Ask for clarification** - If an answer is unclear, ask ChatTC to explain differently

## Privacy

ChatTC conversations are:

- Not stored permanently
- Not shared with other users
- Not used to train AI models
- Protected by the same security as the rest of the platform
