The Historic Tax Credit (HTC) program is one of the most effective tools for revitalizing historic buildings and driving economic development in older urban cores. It provides a 20% federal tax credit for qualified rehabilitation expenditures (QREs) on certified historic structures.

## How HTC works

To qualify, a project must meet three core requirements:

1. **Certified historic structure**  
   Listed individually on the National Register or contributing to a registered district.

2. **Substantial rehabilitation test**  
   Qualified rehabilitation expenditures must exceed the building's adjusted basis.

3. **Secretary of the Interior standards**  
   Rehabilitation must preserve the building's historic character.

## Why HTC matters

- **Revitalizes aging urban infrastructure** by turning obsolete buildings into productive assets
- **Supports adaptive reuse** instead of demolition
- **Attracts private capital** into challenging locations
- **Creates jobs and anchors community redevelopment** through new tenants and uses

## Common challenges

- Managing the Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 application and approval process
- Allocating costs correctly between QREs and non‑QREs
- Structuring twinned HTC + NMTC deals where both programs have distinct rules
- Timing construction draws, placed‑in‑service dates, and compliance periods

## How tCredex helps

tCredex simplifies HTC structuring by:

- **Standardizing QRE tracking** across contractors and cost categories
- **Supporting twinned credit structures** with templates for HTC + NMTC and HTC + LIHTC
- **Automating documentation** for investors and advisors
- **Providing compliance workflows** around Part 1–3 and the 5‑year recapture period

HTC deals are complex — but with the right tools, they become powerful catalysts for community transformation instead of one‑off headaches.
