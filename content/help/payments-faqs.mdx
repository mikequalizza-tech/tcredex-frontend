## Is tCredex free to use?

Yes. Submitting a project, generating a DealCard, and receiving AutoMatch recommendations are all free.  
Premium features may be introduced in the future, but the core Marketplace remains free for developers and nonprofits.

## What do I pay for on tCredex?

Most users never pay anything.  
Optional paid features may include:

- Enhanced project visibility
- Advanced analytics
- Priority matching
- Additional Closing Room tools

If a feature requires payment, it will be clearly labeled before you activate it.

## What payment methods does tCredex accept?

tCredex supports major credit cards and standard online payment methods.  
Additional payment options may be added as the platform expands.

---

## Do I need to enter payment information to submit a project?

No. You can submit projects, reach Tier 1, and appear on the Marketplace without entering any payment information.

---

## Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan later?

Yes. If you choose a paid plan in the future, you’ll be able to switch tiers at any time.  
Changes take effect immediately, and your billing adjusts automatically.

---

## Can I cancel a paid plan?

Yes. You can cancel at any time.  
Your plan remains active through the end of the billing cycle, and you won’t be charged again.

---

## Do you offer refunds?

Refunds may be available for accidental charges or technical issues.  
For help, contact **support@tcredex.com**.

## Will pricing change in the future?

As new features roll out, pricing may evolve.  
Any changes will be communicated clearly and will never affect your current plan without your approval.
