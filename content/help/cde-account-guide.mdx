## What is a CDE on tCredex?

**CDEs (Community Development Entities)** are certified intermediaries that receive NMTC allocation from the CDFI Fund and deploy it to qualified projects in low-income communities.

On tCredex, CDEs find high-quality projects, evaluate eligibility, issue LOIs, and move deals toward closing.

---

## Your CDE Dashboard

After logging in, your dashboard shows:

### Allocation Overview

- Total allocation by year
- Deployed vs. remaining
- Deployment deadline alerts

### Pipeline

Projects you're actively working:
- Flagged for review
- LOI issued
- In Closing Room

### Matches

New projects matching your criteria from AutoMatch.

## Step 2: Find Projects

### AutoMatch (Recommended)

AutoMatch analyzes new projects against your preferences:

1. Set your criteria in your CDE Profile
2. Receive notifications when matching projects appear
3. Review matches from your dashboard

Match scores reflect:
- Geographic fit (is project in your target area?)
- Sector alignment (does it match your focus?)
- Distress level (does tract meet requirements?)
- Deal size (is QLICI in your range?)
- Readiness (can it close in time?)

### Marketplace Browse

Browse all active projects directly:

1. Go to **Marketplace**
2. Apply filters (state, sector, size, program)
3. Review DealCards
4. Flag interesting projects

---

## Step 3: Evaluate DealCards

Each DealCard shows:

### Project Summary
- Name, type, location
- Sponsor information
- Project description

### Eligibility
- Census tract GEOID
- NMTC eligibility status
- Distress indicators (poverty, MFI, unemployment)
- Severely distressed flag

### Financials
- Total Project Cost
- QLICI Request
- Financing gap
- Sources and uses

### Impact
- Jobs created/retained
- Community benefit
- Special designations

### Readiness
- Site control status
- Environmental status
- Timeline / projected close

### Documents
- Available due diligence materials

---

## Step 4: Express Interest

When you find a project worth pursuing:

### Flag for Review

1. Click **Flag for Review** on the DealCard
2. Project moves to your Pipeline
3. Internal notes (optional)

### Request Information

1. Click **Request Info**
2. Specify what you need
3. Sponsor receives notification

### Express Interest

1. Click **Express Interest**
2. Sponsor sees your interest
3. Communication unlocks when mutual

---

## Step 5: Issue Letter of Intent (LOI)

When you're ready to proceed:

### Move to Closing Room

1. Both parties agree to proceed
2. Closing Room opens
3. Document exchange begins

### Draft LOI

1. Go to **Issue LOI** in Closing Room
2. Specify terms:
   - Allocation amount
   - QLICI rate
   - Leverage structure
   - Expected close date
   - Special conditions

### Send LOI

### LOI Responses

| Declined | Deal ends or revise |

---

## Step 6: Bring in Investor

After LOI acceptance:

1. Identify Investor partner
2. Share deal package
3. Investor conducts underwriting
4. Investor issues commitment
5. All parties proceed to closing

## Step 7: Close the Deal

In the Closing Room:

---

## Pipeline Management

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Flagged | Saved for review |
| Evaluating | Actively reviewing |
| LOI Issued | LOI sent to Sponsor |
| LOI Accepted | Proceeding to commitment |
| Closing | In Closing Room |
| Closed | Deal funded |

### Pipeline Actions

- Add internal notes
- Set follow-up reminders
- Archive declined deals

---

## Tips for Success

### Set Specific Preferences

Generic preferences = generic matches. Tell the system exactly what you're looking for.

### Respond Quickly

Sponsors have choices. Fast response signals serious interest.

### Track Your Deadlines

Deployment pressure increases as deadlines approach. Stay ahead.

### Use the Map

Browse the map to find projects in your target areas that might not have matched yet.
