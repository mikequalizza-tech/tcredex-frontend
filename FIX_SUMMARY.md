# Fix Summary: pnpm Build & AUTH/Onboarding Issues

**Date:** January 23, 2026  
**Issue:** Frontend build failing with pnpm, AUTH and Onboarding not working with backend integration

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Duplicate Import Statement
**File:** `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`  
**Problem:** Had duplicate `import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';` statements causing webpack compilation failure  
**Solution:** Removed duplicate import and orphaned code, cleaned up the file

### 2. ✅ Merge Conflict Markers
**File:** `.env.local`  
**Problem:** Git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) were left in the file  
**Solution:** Resolved all merge conflicts, kept the correct configuration

### 3. ✅ Backend API URL Mismatch
**File:** `.env.local`  
**Problem:** 
- `.env.local` had `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3004`
- `.env.example` correctly had `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- Backend actually runs on port 8080
- This was causing AUTH and Onboarding to fail (connection refused)

**Solution:** Updated `.env.local` to use the correct backend URL:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### 4. ✅ pnpm Workspace Configuration
**File:** `pnpm-workspace.yaml`  
**Problem:** Corrupted configuration with individual letters instead of proper package definitions  
**Solution:** Fixed to proper workspace configuration:
```yaml
packages:
  - '.'
```

### 5. ✅ Old Clerk Auth Route
**File:** `app/(auth)/signin/[[...signin]]/page.tsx`  
**Problem:** 
- Leftover from old Clerk authentication system
- Trying to use undefined `SignIn` component
- Conflicting with new Supabase auth implementation

**Solution:** Removed the entire directory - the correct Supabase-based signin page exists at `app/(auth)/signin/page.tsx`

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why AUTH and Onboarding Weren't Working

1. **Wrong Backend URL**: The frontend was trying to connect to `localhost:3004` but the backend runs on `localhost:8080`
2. **Build Failures**: The duplicate imports prevented the app from building successfully
3. **Old Auth Code**: Remnants of Clerk authentication were interfering with Supabase auth

### Why pnpm Build Was Failing

1. **Webpack compilation error** from duplicate imports
2. **Invalid pnpm workspace config** causing dependency resolution issues
3. **TypeScript errors** from missing/undefined components (SignIn from Clerk)

## Verification

### Build Test
```bash
pnpm build
```
**Result:** ✅ Build successful - all routes compiled without errors

### Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```
**Result:** ✅ Server starts on port 3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is busy)

## How to Run Frontend + Backend Together

### Backend (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd /path/to/tcredex-backend
npm run dev  # Starts on port 8080
```

### Frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd /path/to/tcredex-frontend
pnpm dev     # Starts on port 3000
```

### Required Environment Variables

**Frontend (.env.local):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080  # MUST match backend port
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

**Backend (.env):**
```bash
PORT=8080  # Default port - frontend expects this
# ... other backend env vars
```

## Testing AUTH Flow

1. Start backend on port 8080
2. Start frontend on port 3000
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/signup
4. Fill out registration form
5. Submit → Should create account via backend API
6. Redirected to dashboard
7. Try signing out and signing back in

## Documentation Created

1. **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Comprehensive development guide covering:
   - Prerequisites and setup
   - Frontend + Backend integration
   - AUTH troubleshooting
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Environment variables reference

2. **README.md** - Updated with:
   - Quick start guide
   - Link to DEVELOPMENT.md
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Proper tech stack documentation

## Files Changed

1. `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` - Fixed duplicate imports, cleaned up
2. `.env.local` - Resolved merge conflicts, corrected backend URL
3. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Fixed workspace configuration
4. `app/(auth)/signin/[[...signin]]/page.tsx` - Removed (old Clerk code)
5. `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Created (new documentation)
6. `README.md` - Updated (improved documentation)

## Known Warnings (Non-Breaking)

The build shows some warnings about Supabase Realtime using Node.js APIs in Edge Runtime. These are **warnings only** and do not affect functionality:

```
⚠ Compiled with warnings
./node_modules/.pnpm/@supabase+realtime-js@2.87.1/...
A Node.js API is used (process.versions) which is not supported in the Edge Runtime.
```

These can be safely ignored as they don't impact the application's core functionality.

## Recommendations

1. **Always start backend before frontend** for development
2. **Verify backend is running** with: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/health`
3. **Check .env.local** if AUTH issues occur - it should have port 8080
4. **Use the same port** for backend in all environments (8080)
5. **Refer to DEVELOPMENT.md** for detailed setup instructions

## Success Criteria ✅

- [x] Frontend builds successfully with `pnpm build`
- [x] Development server starts without errors
- [x] Backend API URL correctly configured (port 8080)
- [x] No merge conflicts in configuration files
- [x] Old authentication code removed
- [x] Comprehensive documentation provided
- [x] AUTH flow can connect to backend
- [x] Onboarding flow has correct endpoint configuration

## Next Steps

1. Test full AUTH flow with backend running
2. Verify onboarding completes successfully
3. Test role-specific dashboards (sponsor, CDE, investor)
4. Run full integration tests with backend
