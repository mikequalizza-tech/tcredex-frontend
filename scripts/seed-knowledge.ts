    content: `# New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program Overview

## What is the NMTC Program?
The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program was established by Congress in 2000 as part of the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act. The program is designed to stimulate investment and economic growth in low-income urban and rural communities.

## How It Works
1. **CDFI Fund Allocation**: The Treasury Department's Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund allocates tax credit authority to Community Development Entities (CDEs)
2. **Investment Structure**: Investors make Qualified Equity Investments (QEIs) in CDEs
3. **Credit Claim**: Investors receive a 39% federal tax credit over 7 years (5% years 1-3, 6% years 4-7)
4. **Community Investment**: CDEs use the capital to make qualified investments in businesses located in Low-Income Communities (LICs)

## Key Terms
- **CDE (Community Development Entity)**: A domestic corporation or partnership with a primary mission of serving low-income communities
- **QALICB (Qualified Active Low-Income Community Business)**: A business that qualifies to receive NMTC investment
- **QEI (Qualified Equity Investment)**: The investment that generates the tax credit
- **QLICI (Qualified Low-Income Community Investment)**: The loan or investment made by the CDE to the QALICB

## Eligibility Requirements
### Geographic Eligibility
- Project must be located in a Low-Income Community census tract
- LIC tracts have poverty rate ≥20% OR median family income ≤80% of area median

### Business Requirements (QALICB Tests)
1. **Location Test**: At least 50% of gross income from active conduct of business in LIC
2. **Services Test**: At least 40% of tangible property in LIC
3. **Employee Test**: At least 40% of employees' services performed in LIC (for employers with 5+ FTEs)

### Prohibited Uses
- Sin businesses (golf courses, gambling, liquor stores)
- Residential rental property (use LIHTC instead)
- Farming

## Benefits
- Effectively reduces project financing costs by up to 20-25%
- Gap financing for community development projects
- Can be combined with other credits (HTC, state credits)
- Supports job creation in underserved communities

## Common Project Types
- Healthcare facilities and clinics
- Manufacturing facilities
- Charter schools and educational facilities
- Community facilities
- Mixed-use commercial developments
- Grocery stores in food deserts

## tCredex Platform Features for NMTC
- Check tract eligibility using the Map feature
- Submit deals via the Intake Form
- Connect with CDEs through the Marketplace
- Use AutoMatch AI to find suitable CDEs
- Track compliance in the Closing Room`

    title: 'NMTC Deal Structure and Pricing',
    content: `# NMTC Deal Structure and Pricing Guide

## Standard NMTC Transaction Structure

### Leverage Loan Structure (Most Common)
1. **Investment Entity (IE)**: Usually LLC formed by investor
2. **Leverage Lender**: Provides loan to IE (often the QALICB or sponsor)
3. **QEI**: IE makes equity investment in CDE
4. **CDE Sub**: CDE makes subsidiary to hold QLICI
5. **QALICB**: Operating entity receives QLICI loan

### Key Relationships
- Investor puts in equity (receives tax credits)
- Leverage loan creates the "put" structure
- CDE fee typically 1-3% annually
- QALICB receives below-market financing

## NMTC Credit Calculation

### 39% Total Credit Over 7 Years
| Year | Credit Rate | Cumulative |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | 5% | 5% |
| 2 | 5% | 10% |
| 3 | 5% | 15% |
| 4 | 6% | 21% |
| 5 | 6% | 27% |
| 6 | 6% | 33% |
| 7 | 6% | 39% |

### Net Benefit Calculation
- QEI Amount: $10,000,000
- Gross Credit: $3,900,000
- Less: Investor fees, compliance costs
- Net Benefit to Project: ~$2,000,000-$2,500,000 (20-25% of QEI)

## Current Market Pricing (2024)

### Credit Pricing
- National average: $0.78-$0.85 per credit dollar
- Actual net benefit varies by:
  - Deal size
  - Geographic location
  - Project type
  - CDE allocation availability

### Fee Structure
- CDE fees: 1-3% of QEI annually
- Asset management: 0.5-1% annually
- Legal/closing costs: $150,000-$300,000
- Compliance monitoring: $10,000-$25,000 annually

## Key Compliance Requirements

### 7-Year Compliance Period
- Substantially all (85%+) of QEI proceeds must remain invested in QLICIs
- QALICB must maintain qualification throughout
- Annual reporting to CDFI Fund required

### Recapture Events
- CDE ceases to be certified
- QEI redeemed before 7 years
- QALICB fails qualification tests
- Less than substantially all invested in QLICIs

## Exit at Year 7
- Leverage loan "put" exercise
- Investor exits with nominal payment ($1,000)
- Project typically retains assets
- Below-market financing converts to ownership`
