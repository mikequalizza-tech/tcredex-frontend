While federal tax-credit programs get most of the attention, state tax credits often determine whether a project pencils out. These programs vary widely by state but share a common purpose: to attract private capital into projects that deliver public benefit.

## What are state tax credits?

State tax credits reduce state income tax liability for investors or project sponsors. They can be:

- **Transferable**
- **Refundable**
- **Non-refundable**
- **Allocated competitively**
- **Statutory or capped**

Common state-level programs include:

- State LIHTC
- State HTC
- Film and media credits
- Brownfield and environmental remediation credits
- Renewable energy credits
- Job creation and investment credits

## Why state credits matter

State credits often:

- **Fill critical financing gaps** in challenging markets
- **Improve investor yield** and pricing
- **Strengthen project feasibility** for catalytic or policy-driven projects
- **Support local economic development** aligned with state priorities

In many deals, the state credit is the difference between "almost feasible" and "fully capitalized."

## Challenges in state credit deals

- Highly variable program rules and documentation standards
- Transferability mechanics and pricing negotiations
- Timing of monetization relative to construction schedules
- Interaction with federal credits and basis rules
- Ongoing compliance and recapture risk
