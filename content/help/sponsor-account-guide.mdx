## What is a Sponsor?

On tCredex, **Sponsors** are developers, nonprofits, and community organizations that originate projects seeking tax credit financing.

If you're building a community facility, affordable housing, historic renovation, or economic development project—you're a Sponsor.

---

## Your Sponsor Dashboard

After logging in, your dashboard shows:

### Pipeline

All your projects in various stages:
- **Draft** - Started but not submitted
- **Intake** - Submitted, generating DealCard
- **Matched** - Receiving CDE/Investor interest
- **Closing** - In due diligence

### Matches

CDEs and Investors who have expressed interest in your projects.

### Messages

Communications from potential partners.

### Documents

Files you've uploaded across all projects.

---

## Step 1: Submit Your First Project

### Start the Intake Form

1. Click **Submit Project** from your dashboard
2. Or go directly to [tcredex.com/intake](/intake)

### Fill Out Required Sections

To reach Tier 1 (Marketplace visibility), complete:

1. **Project Information** - Name, type, description
2. **Location** - Address (auto-populates census tract)
3. **Programs** - Which credits you're seeking
4. **Sponsor Info** - Your organization details
5. **Total Project Cost** - Overall budget

| **Tier 3** | 100% | Due diligence ready, priority matching |

### Preview Your DealCard

As you fill out the form, preview how your DealCard will appear to CDEs and Investors.

## Step 2: Select Your Programs

The Intake Form dynamically adapts based on which programs you select:

### NMTC (New Markets Tax Credit)

- Requires QALICB eligibility tests
- Will match you with CDEs
- CDE then brings in Investor

### LIHTC (Low-Income Housing Tax Credit)

- Shows housing-specific fields
- Matches directly with Investors
- **Cannot be combined with NMTC**

- Shows QRE and historic designation fields
- Matches directly with Investors

## Step 4: Publish Your DealCard

2. Click **Publish to Marketplace**
3. Your project goes live

CDEs and Investors can now:
- View your DealCard
- Save to their pipeline
- Express interest
- Request information

## Step 5: Respond to Matches

### When You Receive a Match

AutoMatch notifies you when a CDE or Investor fits your project:

1. Review their profile
2. See their investment/deployment criteria
3. Decide whether to engage

### Expressing Mutual Interest

When both parties express interest:
- Communication unlocks
- You can enter the Closing Room
- Due diligence begins

---

## Step 6: Enter the Closing Room

The Closing Room is where deals move forward:

### Your Responsibilities

- Upload requested documents
- Respond to questions
- Provide additional information
- Track checklist progress

### What to Expect

For **NMTC deals:**
1. CDE reviews your materials
2. CDE issues Letter of Intent (LOI)
3. You review and accept/negotiate
4. CDE brings in Investor
5. Full commitment and closing

For **Direct deals (LIHTC, HTC, OZ):**
1. Investor reviews your materials
2. Investor issues commitment letter
3. You review and accept/negotiate
4. Proceed to closing

## Managing Multiple Projects

Sponsors often have multiple active projects:

### From Your Dashboard

- View all projects at once
- See status of each
- Track matches across projects
- Manage documents centrally

### Project Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | Not yet submitted |
| Intake | In review, building DealCard |
| Active | On Marketplace, receiving matches |
| Matched | In discussions with CDE/Investor |
| Closing | In Closing Room |
| Closed | Deal completed |

## Tips for Success

### Complete Your Profile

CDEs and Investors check Sponsor credibility. Include:
- Organization history
- Past projects (if any)
- Team experience

### Aim for Tier 3

Higher completion = better matches. Tier 3 projects get priority attention.

### Respond Quickly

When a CDE or Investor reaches out, respond within 24-48 hours. Deals move to active partners.

### Keep Documents Current

Upload new documents as they become available. Fresh materials signal deal progress.
