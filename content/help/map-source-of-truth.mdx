## The Map is Everything

The tCredex map isn't just a visual tool—it's the foundation of the entire platform. Every eligibility determination, every match score, and every compliance check traces back to the map.

## What the Map Shows

### Census Tract Eligibility

Every census tract in the United States is classified:

| Layer | What It Shows |
|-------|---------------|
| **NMTC Eligible** | Tracts qualifying for New Markets Tax Credits |
| **Severely Distressed** | High-priority NMTC tracts with deeper need |
| **Opportunity Zones** | Designated OZ tracts for capital gains benefits |
| **QCT (Qualified Census Tracts)** | LIHTC bonus areas |
| **State Programs** | State-specific tax credit eligibility |

### Distress Indicators

Each tract displays:
- **Poverty Rate** - Percentage below poverty line
- **Median Family Income** - As % of area median
- **Unemployment Rate** - Local jobless rate
- **Classification** - Urban, rural, tribal

## How the Map Drives the System

### 1. Address Lookup → Instant Eligibility

When a Sponsor enters a project address:

1. System geocodes the address to coordinates
2. Coordinates map to a census tract (GEOID)
3. Tract data returns eligibility for ALL programs
4. DealCard auto-populates with tract information

**No manual eligibility research needed.** The map tells you instantly what programs your project qualifies for.

### 2. Tract Data → Match Scoring

AutoMatch uses tract data to score matches:

- CDE prefers severely distressed tracts? Projects in those tracts score higher.
- Investor focuses on Opportunity Zones? OZ-eligible projects surface first.
- State program available? System flags state credit opportunities.

### 3. Map Exploration → Deal Discovery

CDEs and Investors can:

- Browse the map to find eligible areas
- Filter by distress level, program, or state
- Click tracts to see active projects
- Identify underserved markets with allocation need

## Eligibility Layers Explained

### NMTC Eligibility

A tract qualifies for NMTC if it meets ANY of these:
- Poverty rate ≥ 20%
- Median income ≤ 80% of area median
- Unemployment ≥ 1.5x national average

**Severely Distressed** tracts have even deeper indicators—CDEs often prioritize these.

### Opportunity Zones

Designated by governors in 2018, OZ tracts offer:
- Capital gains deferral
- Step-up in basis after 5/7 years
- Tax-free appreciation after 10 years

### Qualified Census Tracts (QCT)

For LIHTC, QCTs provide:
- 30% basis boost for 9% and 4% deals
- Higher credit value per unit

### State Programs

Each state has unique programs with their own eligible areas. The map shows:
- State NMTC programs
- State HTC programs
- Brownfield incentives
- Other state-specific credits

## The Map is the Source of Truth

Every data point flows from the map:

```
MAP DATA
   │
   ├── Intake Form (auto-populates eligibility)
   │
   ├── DealCard (displays tract info)
   │
   ├── AutoMatch (scores geographic fit)
   │
   └── Compliance (verifies requirements)
```

When the map says a tract is eligible, the system treats it as eligible. When the map shows distress metrics, those drive scoring. The map is not decorative—it's authoritative.
