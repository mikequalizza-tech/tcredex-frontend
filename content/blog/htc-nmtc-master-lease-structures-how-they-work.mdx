Combining Historic Tax Credits (HTC) and New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC) can unlock transformative redevelopment projects — but the structure is complex. The HTC/NMTC master lease model is the most widely used approach for twinned deals.

## Why use a master lease structure?

The master lease structure allows:

- HTC investors to claim credits through a lessee entity
- NMTC investors to participate through a leverage structure
- Separation of ownership and operations
- Flexibility in allocating QREs and QLICI proceeds

It's a structure born from necessity — aligning two programs with different rules, timelines, and compliance frameworks.

## Core components

### 1. Property owner (fee owner)

Holds title to the historic building and performs the rehabilitation.

### 2. Master tenant (lessee)

Leases the property from the owner and claims the HTC, subject to program rules and ownership tests.

### 3. NMTC structure

Typically includes:

- A **leverage lender** providing debt into the NMTC investment fund
- An **investment fund** receiving equity from the NMTC investor
- One or more **CDEs** making QLICIs
- A **QALICB**, often the master tenant or a related entity

### 4. QRE allocation

Qualified Rehabilitation Expenditures must be properly allocated to the master tenant so that entity can validly claim the HTC.

### 5. Compliance periods

- HTC: 5-year recapture period
- NMTC: 7-year compliance period

The structure must survive both without tripping recapture.

## Common challenges

- Aligning QRE timing with NMTC disbursements and placed-in-service dates
- Managing related-party rules between owner, master tenant, and QALICB
- Ensuring the master tenant is a valid HTC claimant
- Coordinating exit strategies that work for both HTC and NMTC investors
