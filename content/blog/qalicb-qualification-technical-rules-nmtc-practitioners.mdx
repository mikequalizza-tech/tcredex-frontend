The Qualified Active Low-Income Community Business (QALICB) test is the backbone of NMTC compliance. If the operating entity fails this test, the entire structure is at risk.

## The five core tests

### 1. Gross income test

At least 50% of gross income must be derived from activities in a Low-Income Community (LIC).

### 2. Tangible property test

At least 40% of the tangible property must be located in an LIC.

### 3. Services performed test

At least 40% of services must be performed in an LIC, often measured by payroll or hours.

### 4. Collectibles restriction

No more than 5% of property can be collectibles, such as art or similar assets.

### 5. Nonqualified financial property (NQFP)

No more than 5% of assets can be NQFP, such as certain financial instruments and excess cash.

## Common pitfalls

- Misclassifying revenue sources between LIC and non-LIC activities
- Incorrectly allocating property across locations or facilities
- Failing to track service hours or payroll by geography
- Holding excess cash or financial instruments beyond allowed limits

## Why QALICB qualification is hard

- Multi-entity ownership and operating structures
- Businesses with multiple locations, some in and some out of LICs
- Construction and start-up periods where revenue is limited or evolving
- Blended NMTC + HTC or OZ deals where multiple regimes interact
