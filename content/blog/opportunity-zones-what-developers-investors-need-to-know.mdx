Opportunity Zones (OZs) were created to drive long-term investment into low-income communities by offering significant capital gains tax incentives to investors. The core idea is simple: roll capital gains into a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF), deploy that capital into Opportunity Zone projects, and get rewarded for patient capital.

## How OZs work

Investors can defer, reduce, or eliminate capital gains taxes by reinvesting gains into QOFs, which then deploy capital into Qualified Opportunity Zone Businesses (QOZBs) or property.

### Key benefits

- **Deferral** of original capital gains until the legislated recognition date
- **Potential reduction** of taxable gains based on prior holding provisions
- **Elimination of gains** on the OZ investment itself when held 10+ years

## What makes OZs unique

Unlike other tax-credit programs:

- There is **no allocation authority** or centralized award process
- Capital is **market-driven** and depends on investor appetite
- Compliance hinges on **asset tests**, **substantial improvement**, and **working capital safe harbors**, not on tax-credit allocations

## Common challenges

- Maintaining the 90% QOF asset test across reporting periods
- Designing QOZBs that can accommodate operating businesses and real estate
- Aligning OZ rules with NMTC or HTC when projects use blended structures
- Documenting working capital safe harbor plans and execution

## How tCredex supports OZ projects

tCredex provides:

- **Compliance tracking** for 90% asset tests and QOZB thresholds
- **Standardized QOZB structuring templates** for real estate and operating businesses
- **Documentation support** for investor and regulatory reporting
- **Integration with other programs**, so OZ can sit alongside NMTC, HTC, and state credits

Opportunity Zones remain a powerful tool — but only when compliance is managed with precision and data, not guesswork.
