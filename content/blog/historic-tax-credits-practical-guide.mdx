This case study highlights how a distressed historic building in a Qualified Low-Income Community was transformed using a blended NMTC + HTC structure — and how standardized workflows accelerated closing.

## Project background

- **Location:** Midwestern urban core
- **Asset:** 120-year-old historic commercial building
- **Total development cost:** $32M
- **Credits used:** NMTC, Federal HTC, State HTC

The project converted the building into a mixed-use community hub with workforce training, small business incubation, and cultural programming.

## The challenge

The sponsor faced:

- A complex HTC/NMTC master lease structure
- QRE timing misalignment with NMTC funding
- Multiple CDEs with different underwriting standards
- A tight closing timeline driven by cost escalation risk

## The approach

The team used standardized templates and workflows to:

- Align QRE schedules with QLICI disbursements
- Validate QALICB qualification early in the process
- Model the master lease structure before drafting documents
- Generate investor-ready documentation packages consistently across parties

## The results

- **Closing time reduced by 30%** compared to similar prior deals
- **Documentation errors reduced by 70%** through template-driven drafting
- **Compliance risks identified early**, not at the eleventh hour
- **Investor confidence increased**, enabling better pricing and smoother approvals

## Key takeaways

- Standardization accelerates blended deals and reduces friction
- Early compliance validation prevents rework and renegotiation
- Master lease structures benefit from clear, visual entity mapping
- A shared platform keeps everyone working from the same playbook
