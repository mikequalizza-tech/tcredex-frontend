# tCredex Intake Form — Quick Start Guide (Beginner Friendly Edition)
Welcome to tCredex
The Intake Form is your first step to getting your project in front of Community Development Entities (CDEs), investors, and partners.
Think of it as your project passport — once completed, it unlocks your DealCard, Marketplace listing, and automated matching.
You don’t need to be a tax credit expert.
You don’t need every document ready.
You just need to start.
How to Begin

1. Go to the Intake Form
   Visit tcredex.com/intake or click Submit Project from your dashboard.
2. Your Progress Saves Automatically
   You can leave anytime and return later. No accounts, no drafts, no stress.
3. Complete Sections in Any Order
   Jump around freely. Fill out what you know now and return to the rest later.
4. Preview Your DealCard Anytime
   See how your project will appear on the Marketplace before you publish.
   Your Completion Tier (What You Unlock)
   As you fill out the form, your completion percentage increases.
   Each tier unlocks new visibility and matching capabilities.

Most users aim for Tier 1 first — it gets your project in front of CDEs quickly.
