## What is the Closing Room?

The Closing Room is tCredex's secure workspace where matched parties conduct due diligence and move deals toward closing.

Think of it as your virtual deal room — all documents, communications, and checklists in one place.

---

## Who Uses the Closing Room?

Once a match progresses past initial interest:

- **Sponsors** upload documents and respond to requests
- **CDEs** review materials and issue LOIs
- **Investors** evaluate opportunities and issue commitments
- **Advisors** (attorneys, accountants) access relevant sections

---

## Entering the Closing Room

You enter the Closing Room when:

1. A CDE or investor invites you after expressing interest
2. You accept a match and both parties agree to proceed
3. An LOI or commitment is issued
